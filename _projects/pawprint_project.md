		<span>The PawPrint Inertial and Magnetic Measurement Unit (IMMU) is an Open-Source sensor solution that I have designed and continue to develop. The project was funded via a Research Grant awarded by the Battersea Dogs & Cats Home and sought to create a sensor solution that was as low-cost as possible while also being developed with input from both researchers and shelter staff. </span>
