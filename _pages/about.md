I'm a behavioural ecologist and applied ethologist using [novel technologies](https://josullivan93.github.io/projects/pawprint_project/), statistics and [deep learning](https://josullivan93.github.io/projects/pile_detect_project/) to supplement more traditional observation-bassed methodologies and analyses. I have worked on a range of species from [baboons](https://josullivan93.github.io/projects/baboon_project/) and [dogs](https://josullivan93.github.io/projects/dogbox_project/) to [chickens](https://josullivan93.github.io/projects/thermal_feathers_project/). My research techniques allow for the non-invasive, longitudinal collection of physiological and behavioural data at frequencies and resolutions difficult to capture with human observation and annotation. By utilising these methods I aim to ask and answer novel questions that can further improve how we understand, interact with, and manage wild and domestic species to our mutual benefit.

To undertake this research I have developed a varied skillset at the interface of behavioural ecology and technology. These skills include:
  - Multiple programming and statistical languages (R, Python, C, Java, SQL, Matlab).
  - Observation, annotation, and analyses of behaviour in both free-ranging and captive/controlled individuals.
  - Experimental design that incorporates the idiosyncracies of species, resources, and environment to produce robust data addressing research questions.
  - Implementation of cutting edge technologies where appropriate and to appraise their use practically (thermography, acoustic monitoring, computer vision, GPS, activity monitoring etc.)
  - Experience of hardware design of custom sensor devices, & software design of custom applications, programs & workflows.
  - Science communication across diverse settings and audiences (international conferences, government stakeholders, lay audiences, etc.)

These abilities, and other skills, are presented in more detail on my [CV](https://josullivan93.github.io/cv/), and their use in past research is described across this sites [Project pages](https://josullivan93.github.io/projects/).

I strongly believe that science should be open and accessible to all. In an effort to improve access to low-cost sensor-based research I have designed and produced the PawPrint Sensor as an open-source project. Further details on this can be found on the [Pawprint Project page](https://josullivan93.github.io/projects/) and files can be accessed on the [PawPrint Open Science Framework page](https://osf.io/kz6nw/).
